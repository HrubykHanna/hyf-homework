Sesame seared salmon
Ingredients
2 x 130 g salmon fillets, skin on, scaled, pin-boned
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 bunch of mint (30g)
2 large oranges
extra virgin olive oil
red wine vinegar
1 x 250 g packet of cooked mixed grains
2 small carrots
2 heaped teaspoons harissa
Method
Halve the salmon fillets lengthways, then cut the skin off each piece. Scatter the sesame seeds across a plate, then lay the salmon slices in them to completely coat one side only. Pour the excess sesame seeds into a pestle and mortar and pound into a paste. Pick and pound in most of the mint leaves, saving the pretty ones, muddle in the juice of 1 orange and a swig each of extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar, then season to perfection. Put a 30cm non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat, add the grains with a good splash of water, and heat through. Once hot, pour in the dressing, toss together well, then remove to a platter or serving bowl.
